{"name":"CAB Undergraduate Journal Club","tagline":"For Future Scientists","body":"# CAB Undergraduate Journal Club #\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n##What is a journal club##\r\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_club), a journal club is:\r\n>a group of individuals who meet regularly to critically evaluate recent articles in the academic literature, generally of some branch of science or philosophy.\r\n\r\n根据[维基百科](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_club)的定义,文献研讨会（journal club）即为：\r\n>一群人定期聚会以批判性地评价最新的学术文献文章，这些文献通常来自科学或哲学的某些领域\r\n\r\nThe history of journal clubs can be dated back to 1875, when Sir William Osler established the first formalized journal club at McGill University in Montreal with the purpose of \"the purchase and distribution of periodicals to which he could ill afford to subscribe\". Nowadays, Internet has enabled researchers to download literature online within a click, but journal clubs still remain a very common and significant part in modern graduate education system. However, they have been relatively underused in the education of undergraduates,especially for Chinese students.\r\n\r\nJournal Club的历史可以追溯到1875年，威廉-奥斯勒爵士在加拿大蒙特利尔的麦吉尔大学建立了第一个正式的文献研讨会，目的在于“购买和发放个人财力不足以以订阅的期刊”。如今，互联网使得研究者能够很容易地在线下载学术文献，但文献研讨会仍然在现代的研究生教育中占有重要地位。然而，文献研讨会在本科生的教育中通常较少被利用，尤其是对中国学生而言。\r\n\r\nJournal clubs can be very effective platforms where the students can gather first-hand knowledge on analyzing, evaluating, dissecting, and utilizing the scientific literature. (Biswas,2011) Planned, structured sessions with well-defined learning objectives, suitably designed to evoke participants′ interest and attendance are essential to the functioning of a journal club.(Valentini& Daniels,1987).Journal clubs are especially of greater benefit to undergradute students in biological sciences, which is a primarily evidence-oriented science domain. Analyzing the validity，relevance and quality of the evidence presented in biological science literature needs to be trained and polished early in undergraduate education for future success in scientific research.\r\n\r\n文献研讨会可以成为一个非常有效的平台供学生获得关于分析、评价、剖析与利用科学文献的第一手知识（Biswas，2011）。有计划，有组织的研讨、明确的学习目标、能够唤起参与者兴趣的安排和参与度对文献研讨会成功发挥作用必不可少(Valentini& Daniels,1987)。对于学习生物学科这一“证据导向”科学的本科生，文献研讨会尤为有益。早在本科学习期间，分析生物科学文献中证据的可信度、相关性和质量的技能就需要被训练和强化，以期学生在未来的学术研究中获得成功。\r\n##Who are we##\r\n*CAB Undergraduate Journal Club (CAB-UJC)* is intended for undergraduate students who wish to become familiar with the scientific literature in plant sciences by learning to select, read, understand, analyze, and orally present summaries of original research papers from the current literature. It is an organization inspired by the story of Professor Rao Yi, the prestigious biologist in NIBS,who organized a journal club for peers to discuss literature in his graduate years. And it is a club set up spontaneously and independently by undergraduates in College of Agriculture and Biotechnology (CAB) in China Agricultural University(CAU). \r\n\r\n农学院本科生文献研讨会（CAB-UJC）面向有意熟悉植物科学领域文献的本科生。他们将会在其中学到如何选择、阅读、理解、分析和口头总结陈述来自最新科学期刊的原创研究文章。本组织的建立受到了NIBS著名生物学家饶毅教授的启发，他在硕士期间和其同侪建立了一个文献讨论会。本组织由中国农业大学农学与生物技术学院本科生自发、独立创立。\r\n## What do we do  ##\r\n\r\nAs a member of CAB-UJC, students would participate in the following academic and social activities:\r\n\r\n作为CAB-UJC的一员将会参与到如下的学术及社交活动中：\r\n\r\n- Weekly discussion: Members of UJC would introduce the literature they read in the past week or/and gives a presentation on their own research. Each member is recommended to focus on one article, with concise and critical introduction on the background,framework,results,conclusion and a summary of the take-home message. Members are also welcomed to introduce the main message of other articles they read in the week. Meanwhile a \"host\" would give a presentation (with Powerpoint slides and recommended to give in English) about the \"topic of the week\" literature(often a review on a specific topic). Every member could be the host according to the rotation mechanism.\r\n\r\n- 每周讨论会：UJC的成员每周将会介绍其一周以来阅读的文献和/或展示其研究的进展。建议成员主要介绍一篇文章，简明而批判性地介绍其研究背景、研究过程的框架、研究结果、结论以及关键要点。也欢迎介绍当周读过的其他文献的要点。同时，主持人将会以ppt的形式（推荐用英语）介绍“本周主题”及相关文献（常为关于该主题的综述文章）。主持人以轮换形式交替担任。\r\n\r\n-   Online sharing: Each   \"topic of the week\" article will be presented on the online platform of our club. Members are also requested to upload the literature they have read befor the discussion in the week onto the online platform. \r\n\r\n- 在线分享：每周讨论的“本周主题”文章将会在网络平台上分享。每个人同样被要求将其要在研讨会上讨论的文章上传到网络平台上。\r\n\r\n- Club lectures: If possible, we would invite graduates students or professors to give lectures on their research and experience. Members are free to ask questions and discuss with them after the planned lectures.\r\n\r\n- 研讨会讲座：如有可能，我们将会邀请研究生或者教授关于其研究和经历做讲座。讲座后任何成员都可以提问和与演讲者讨论。\r\n\r\n- Lecture attendence: Information of lectures in CAU or other universities and institutions will be shared by our members on the online platform. Members can join each other to attend these lectures and discuss about these lectures on the discussion meetings or online.\r\n\r\n- 参加讲座：在农大和其他学校、机构的讲座信息将会在网络平台上分享，成员们可以共同参与这些讲座，并在每周的讨论会或者在线讨论讲座内容。\r\n\r\n- Peer communication: The journal club is not just a place to talk about science. Ideas on career planning, application for graduate programs and any topic you can imagine can be discussed within the club.\r\n\r\n- 同学间的交流： 文献讨论会并非仅仅是讨论科学的地方。职业规划、研究生院申请以及任何其他问题都可以在成员中间进行讨论。\r\n\r\n\r\n## What can we get \r\n\r\nAs a member of CAB-UJC, one can earn the experience, knowledge and inspirations outside classrooms and labs, including:\r\n\r\nCAB-UJC的成员将会获得课堂和实验室之外的经验、知识与灵感，其中包括：\r\n\r\n1. Club members will learn how to read, understand, analyze, and orally summarize a recent scientific paper in the subject areas they are interested in, especially the area of plant sciences.成员们将会学会如何阅读、理解、分析和口头总结在他们感兴趣的领域里最新的科学文献，尤其是植物科学领域。\r\n\r\n2. Club members will learn strategies for making effective oral presentations using slides and graphics and demonstrate creativity for engaging audience participation and discussion.成员们将会学习到进行有效的口头展示、利用幻灯片和图片展示其创造力和吸引听众注意和讨论的方法。\r\n3. Club members will learn to work in groups.成员们将会学会团队合作。\r\n4. Club members will gain support on both scientific research and career planning.\r\n成员们将会得到在科学研究和职业规划方面的支持。\r\n##Who can join##\r\n\r\nAs a nascent academic club, we are planning to constrain the size of the club. Currently, we mainly consider senior students in College of Agriculture and Biotechnology. Junior students and other undergraduate students should show rich experience in lab work and/or equivalent knowledge of senior students to be a member.\r\n\r\n作为一个新生的学术组织，我们计划控制其规模。目前我们主要考虑农学院的大四年级学生。大三及其他年级的本科生若想成为一员需展示出丰富的实验室经验和/或者同等知识水平。\r\n\r\nUndergraduates with the following traits would be favored for our club:\r\n拥有以下特征的学生将会更受到我们的青睐：\r\n\r\n- Interest and passion in biological sciences\r\n\r\n- 对生命科学感兴趣\r\n\r\n- Planning to further studies as a graduate student in relevant majors. And we highly favor students in different subject areas to bring diversity to our club.These areas includes, but are not limited in, plant molecular biology,genetics, plant breeding, horticultural sciences,plant protection, seed science, crop science, plant pathology and entomology.\r\n \r\n- 计划在相关的专业继续深造。考虑到多样化，我们希望能有不同领域的学生参与，这些领域包括但不限于：植物分子生物学，遗传学。植物育种，园艺科学。植物保护，种子科学，作物科学，植物病理学和昆虫学。  \r\n\r\n- Abundant experience in lab work, especially in molecular biology labs.\r\n\r\n- 丰富的实验室工作经历，特别是在分子生物学实验室\r\n\r\n- \"Good\" GPA. Admittedly GPA sometimes cannot reflect the genuine knowledge you have obtained, but we consider it as a sign for study ability and persistence.\r\n\r\n- 优异的学习成绩。诚然，GPA有时无法反映真实的知识水平，但我们将其视作学习能力和意志力的重要标志。\r\n\r\n- Considerable flunency in reading English literature. Our main focus is on literature in English.Members are highly recommended to read as much as three peer-reviewed papers in English every week.\r\n\r\n- 阅读英文文献较为流畅。我们主要关注英文文献，并强烈建议每位成员每周阅读至少三篇经过同行审阅的英文科学文献。\r\n\r\n- Students with graduate admission offer from universities or institutions in China. They are considered to have more free time for the activities of the club.\r\n\r\n- 已被国内院校研究生录取的学生。我们认为其有足够的时间参与研讨会的各项活动。\r\n\r\n- Students aiming at going abroad (United States or Europe) to study as a graduate and to gain a Master or PhD degree. The application for these universities often involves massive reading in the professors you are interested in.\r\n\r\n- 有志于出国留学（美国或欧洲）攻读硕士或博士学位的学生。申请国外院校通常需要阅读大量感兴趣导师的文献。\r\n\r\nOur club will have a strict selection process. However, those who fail to join the club as a formal member can also join the discussion meetings and lectures as guests.\r\n\r\n我们的选择机制较为严格，但无法正式加入的同学也可以作为客人参与我们的讨论会和讲座。\r\n#Time and Location#\r\nNOT DECIDED YET.\r\n\r\n#CONTACT US\r\n    Chief Organizer-Sun Linhan 孙林汉\r\nMajor: Horticulture\r\n\r\nTel : (86) 18810518750\r\n\r\nE-mail: rookieslh@gmail.com\r\n\r\nQQ/Wechat: 1041781440\r\n\r\n##Links\r\n[ CAB Undergraduate Journal Club Official Site](http://rookieslh.github.io/journalclub/)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Story of Raoyi and his Journal Club(《三联生活周刊》2014年第35期）](http://www.duwanjuan.cn/rao_yi_hao_wan_de_xue_wen_tou_ming_de_xue_zhe)\r\n\r\n>为了有更好的学习氛围，饶毅说他和鲁白等经常讨论文献，组织了也许是中国第一个学生的文献讨论会（Journal Club）。鲁白记得，他们有时候自己做英文演讲，这样能克服用英文探讨问题的恐惧。有时候他们请中科院的中青年“海归”来讲课。\r\n\r\n[Journal Club of National Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, CAU](http://symposium.croplab.org/jc/)\r\n\r\n[ORF club (Zhejiang University)](http://zhan.renren.com/orfclub?from=template)\r\n\r\n[Neuroscience Journal Club for Undergraduates(Cornell University)](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/bionb4110/)\r\n\r\n[The CBS Undergraduate Journal Club(University of Minnesota)](http://www.cbs.umn.edu/blogs/bioblog/20140303JournalClub)\r\n\r\n[starseacow文献分享(emuch.net)](http://emuch.net/bbs/search.php?wd=starseacow&fid=&uid=3104096)\r\n\r\n[Role of Journal Clubs in Undergraduate Medical Education(Biswas,2011)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263155/)\r\n\r\n[The journal club.(Valentini& Daniels,1987)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2431212/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
