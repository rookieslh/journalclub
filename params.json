{"name":"CAB Undergraduate Journal Club","tagline":"For Future Scientists","body":"# CAB Undergraduate Journal Club #\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n##What is a journal club##\r\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_club), a journal club is:\r\n>a group of individuals who meet regularly to critically evaluate recent articles in the academic literature, generally of some branch of science or philosophy. \r\n\r\nThe history of journal clubs can be dated back to 1875, when Sir William Osler established the first formalized journal club at McGill University in Montreal with the purpose of \"the purchase and distribution of periodicals to which he could ill afford to subscribe\". Internet has enabled researchers to download literature online within a click, and journal clubs have been a very common and significant part in modern graduate education system. However, they have been relatively underused in the education of undergraduates.\r\n\r\nJournal clubs can be very effective platforms where the students can gather first-hand knowledge on analyzing, evaluating, dissecting, and utilizing the scientific literature. (Biswas,2011)Planned, structured sessions with well-defined learning objectives, suitably designed to evoke participantsâ€² interest and attendance are essential to the functioning of a journal club.(Valentini& Daniels,1987).Journal clubs are especially of greater benefit to undergradute students in biological sciences, which is a primarily evidence-oriented science domain. Analyzing the quality, validity, and relevance of the evidence presented in biological science literature needs to be trained and polished early in undergraduate education for future success in scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Who are we##\r\n*CAB Undergraduate Journal Club (CAB-UJC)* is intended for undergraduate students who wish to become familiar with the scientific literature in plant sciences by learning to select, read, understand, analyze, and orally present summaries of original research papers from the current literature. It is an organization inspired by the story of Rao Yi, the prestigious biologist in NIBS,who organized a journal club for peers to discuss literature in his graduate years. And it is a club set up spontaneously and independently by undergraduates in College of Agriculture and Biotechnology (CAB) in China Agricultural University(CAU). \r\n\r\n## What do we do  ##\r\n\r\nAs a member of CAB-UJC, students would participate in the following academic and social activities:\r\n\r\n- Weekly discussion: Members of UJC would introduce the literature they read in the past week or/and gives a presentation on their own research. Meanwhile a \"host\" would give a presentation (with Powerpoint slides and recommended to give in English) about the \"topic of the week\" literature and answer questions arisen by other members. \r\n\r\n\r\n-   Online sharing: Each week we will have a  \"topic of the week\"  and a classical or innovating literature on this topic. This literature will be presented on the online platform of our club. Members are also requested to upload the literature they have read befor the discussion in the week onto the online platform. \r\n\r\n- Club lectures: If possible, we would invite graduates students or professors to give lectures on their research and experience. Members are free to ask questions and discuss with them after the planned lectures.\r\n- Lecture attendence: Information of lectures in CAU or other universities and institutions will be shared by our members on the online platform. Members can join each other to attend these lectures and discuss about these lectures on the discussion meetings or online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Peer communication: The journal club is not just a place to talk about science. Ideas on career planning, application for graduate programs and any topic you can imagine can be discussed within the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What can we get \r\n\r\nAs a member of CAB-UJC, one can earn the experience, knowledge and inspirations outside classrooms and labs, including:\r\n\r\n1. Club members will learn how to read, analyze, understand, and orally summarize a recent scientific paper in the subject areas they are interested in, especially the area of plant sciences.\r\n2. Club members will learn strategies for making effective oral presentations using slides and graphics and demonstrate creativity for engaging audience participation and discussion.\r\n3. Club members will learn to work in groups.\r\n4. Club members will gain support on both scientific research and career planning.\r\n\r\n##Who can join##\r\n\r\nAs a nascent academic club, we are planning to constrain the size of the club. Currently, we mainly consider senior students in College of Agriculture and Biotechnology. Junior students and other undergraduate students should show rich experience in lab work and/or equivalent knowledge of senior students.\r\n\r\nUndergraduates with the following traits would be favored for our club:\r\n\r\n- Interest and passion in biological sciences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Planning to further studies as a graduate student in relevant majors. And we highly favor students in different subject areas to bring diversity to our club.These areas includes, but are not limited in, plant molecular biology,genetics, plant breeding, horticultural sciences,plant protection, seed science, crop science, plant pathology and entomology.  \r\n\r\n- Abundant experience in lab work, especially in molecular biology labs.\r\n\r\n- \"Good\" GPA. Admittedly GPA cannot reflect the genuine knowledge you have obtained, but we consider it as a sign for study ability and persistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Considerable flunency in reading English literature. Our main focus is on literature in English.Members are highly recommended to read as much as three peer-reviewed papers in English every week.\r\n- Students with graduate admission offer from universities or institutions in China. They are considered to have more free time for the activities of the club.\r\n\r\n- Students aiming at going abroad (United States or Europe) to study as a graduate and to gain a Master or PhD degree. The application for these universities often involves massive reading in the professors you are interested in.\r\n\r\nOur club will have a strict selection process. However, those who fail to join the club as a formal member can also join the discussion meetings and lectures as guests.\r\n\r\n#Time and Location#\r\nNOT DECIDED YET.\r\n\r\n#CONTACT US\r\n    Chief Organizer-Sun Linhan\r\nMajor: Horticulture\r\n\r\nTel : (86) 18810518750\r\n\r\nE-mail: rookieslh@gmail.com\r\n\r\nQQ/Weixin: 1041781440\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
